Christian Rowlands built the Sync Monkey app as an Open Source app. This App is provided by Christian Rowlands at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the App.

WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA.  PERIOD.

We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.

**Log Data**

The App does have the capability to upload files from a user specified directory, but the files are uploaded to a could storage service of the user's choosing.
